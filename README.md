# HR-Analytics---PowerBI
I worked on an HR Analytics project in Power BI where I handled data preparation, modeling, and visualization. The project delivers interactive dashboards with KPI cards, slicers, and charts to analyze attrition, promotions, and workforce performance. All insights are built end-to-end within Power BI.
